This project targets to learn different image processing algorithms, filtering methods, 
colour spaces and using MATLAB guide application for image processing. At the same time, 
the objective of this project is converting an image to cartooned image. 
To able to achieve this purpose, we applied several steps to an image. 
Applied steps gives us different outputs for different images. 
Because of fact that every image has different colour and brightness levels. 
So, we need to use different parameters to able to get ideal cartooned image for every 
image in these steps. Therefore, some cartoonization parameters should be controlled by user. 
By this way, user could get ideal cartooned image by using an MATLAB guide interface prepared by us.
