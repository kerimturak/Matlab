The aim of this project is to design an elevator system that works with a stepper motor and 
to provide floor access control of this elevator with matlab GUI. In addition, it is the 
examination of this height change in a time / displacement graph with the distance sensor
when passing between floors. While the project aims to consolidate our matlab knowledge, 
it also aims to learn stepper motor control with arduino or any controller.
